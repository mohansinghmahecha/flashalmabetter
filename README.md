# Getting Started with Create React App
The Flashcard Generator is an energetic React.js app that aims to assist users in making, arranging, and reviewing flashcards.
This app enables users to produce tailored flashcards by setting up groups with descriptions and putting in separate flashcards with terms, definitions, and related images.
Features: 
Make Groups: Users have the ability to set up groups to arrange their flashcards by subject, topic, or any other classification. Put in Flashcards: Within each group, users can add several flashcards. 
Every flashcard includes: 
Term: A box where you type in the main idea . 
Definition: Another box where you write the matching answer or explanation. 
Image: An extra option that lets you upload a picture 
Responsive: The app is built to look good on any device, so you can make and go over your cards on a computer, tablet, or phone.

Technical Implementation:
React js - React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Redux  -  is a state management tool that helps manage and centralize application state, making it easier to handle complex state logic in React applications
CSS Styling -  Cascading Style Sheets but in this project , i mostly used tailwind css.

Flashcard generator have persistence so when we refresh the previous data didnot gone . which increase its useability
